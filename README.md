## NYC Flights Weather Data Analysis

This project demonstrates a comprehensive analysis of weather data from the nycflights13 dataset, showcasing proficiency in data manipulation, visualization, and statistical inference using R.

### Project Overview

The analysis focuses on weather conditions at New York City airports, utilizing the `weather` dataset from the nycflights13 package. This dataset contains hourly meteorological records including temperature, dew point, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation.

### Key Features

1. **Data Exploration**
   - Utilizes the nycflights13 package to access real-world aviation weather data
   - Employs dplyr for efficient data manipulation
   - Leverages ggplot2 for creating informative and visually appealing graphics

2. **Univariate Analysis**
   - Computes summary statistics for key weather variables (e.g., temperature, humidity)
   - Visualizes distributions using histograms to understand data patterns and outliers

3. **Bivariate Analysis**
   - Explores relationships between weather variables (e.g., temperature vs. dew point)
   - Creates scatter plots with regression lines to visualize correlations
   - Calculates and interprets correlation coefficients

4. **Statistical Inference**
   - Assesses normality of data using both visual (QQ plots) and statistical (Shapiro-Wilk test) methods
   - Performs hypothesis testing using a one-sample t-test to compare mean temperature against a reference value
   - Demonstrates understanding of null and alternative hypotheses in statistical testing

### Technical Highlights

- Efficient use of R libraries: nycflights13, dplyr, and ggplot2
- Implementation of various statistical tests and visualizations
- Clear code structure with comprehensive comments for easy understanding and reproducibility

### Skills Demonstrated

- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Statistical hypothesis testing
- Data visualization using base R and ggplot2
- Interpretation of statistical results

This project showcases practical application of data science techniques to real-world meteorological data, demonstrating proficiency in R programming and statistical analysis. It serves as an excellent example of handling time-series data, performing descriptive and inferential statistics, and drawing meaningful conclusions from complex datasets.
